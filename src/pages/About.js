Machine Learning Engineer,Developper Python,FullStack Django and React JS
I have been passionate about computer Science in general, for many years. The fact to create applications, to configure systems, to control remote machines are are all things that pushed me into this domain.

I am amazed by Artificial Intelligence, the creation of neural networks with Deep Learning to solve difficult problems that escape classical programming. My future career and my professional goal is to become a Machine Learning Engineer
